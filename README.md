# Tic Tac Toe Game - JavaScript Mini Project
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Features:
Two-player Mode: Players alternate between X and O.
Dynamic UI: Updates in real-time with each move.
Win/Draw Detection: Alerts the players when there's a winner or a draw.
Responsive Design: Works on various screen sizes, including mobile devices.

Future Improvements:
Add a single-player mode with AI.
Implement a scoreboard to track wins.
Improve the overall design and animations.
